# Quake-Dungeon-Map

Dungeon Delving is a competitive multiplayer Quake level for two to four players. The theme and setting for the level is an underground medieval dungeon. The level will have a mix of open areas and fast paced close quarter combat. The level is supposed to give off a feeling of being prisoners forced to fight for entertainment to survive. I want players to always be on the move and react to situations that will be different depending on which part of the map they are in.
